# Introduction #

The COSMO-SAC, which is implemented in JCOSMO, was used to calculate the infinite dilution activity coefficients (IDACs) for binary mixtures. The experimental data were taken from the database assembled by Voutsas and Tassios. Then, the graph logarithm of model IDAC versus logarithm of experimental IDAC was mounted.

The graph logarithm of model IDAC versus logarithm of experimental IDAC was used to represent the deviation of experimental and calculated data. This is seen by the distance of point from the diagonal line. The [DiagonalCOSMOSAC.java](http://code.google.com/p/jcosmo/source/browse/trunk/cosmosrc/src/br/ufrgs/enq/jcosmo/test/DiagonalCOSMOSAC.java) file is being used to plot this graph.
